# System Dependencies for MultiModal Assistant

## Ubuntu/Debian systems:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio libasound2-dev

## CentOS/RHEL/Fedora systems:
sudo yum install -y portaudio-devel alsa-lib-devel
# or for newer versions:
sudo dnf install -y portaudio-devel alsa-lib-devel

## macOS (using Homebrew):
brew install portaudio

## For Docker/Container environments:
# Add this to your Dockerfile:
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio libasound2-dev

## Alternative: Use system package manager to install python3-pyaudio
# This can sometimes resolve PortAudio issues:
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
# CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install python3-pyaudio

## Note:
# PortAudio is required for the sounddevice package to work properly.
# Without these system libraries, you'll get "PortAudio library not found" errors.
